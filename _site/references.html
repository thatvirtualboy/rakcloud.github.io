<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="4" data-line-end="5">To Whom It May Concern:</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="8" data-line-end="9">I am honored to take this opportunity to discuss the exceptional qualities and outstanding executive placement services provided by Joe Buonassissi whom I have had the pleasure of knowing and working with, placing candidates for me at FutureCall and S.R. Teleperformance for the past eight years, where I held posts as Vice President of Sales.  I continue today to leverage Joe’s recruiting expertise and vast contact center industry knowledge at West.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="10" data-line-end="11">While this letter will demonstrate Joe’s professionalism and code of ethics, Mr. Buonassissi’s talents stretch well beyond the commerce of executive recruiting.  Joe sets the bar for others by his thoroughness in understanding the assignment and the personal investment he makes in understanding his client’s needs as well as getting to know candidates before he engages any plan of action.  Each party thoroughly understands the mission and each others objectives before anything is commenced.  Joe’s pre and post placement preparation and execution skills are unique unto himself as I would associate his style to more of a ‘coach’ or a ‘consigliore’ than a recruiter.  One example of this is and what made me immediately take notice of Joe was his willingness to better understand my business and how my service offering was unique from that of my competitors.  By doing this, Joe has put the right candidate in the right role for me, every time.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="12" data-line-end="13">Joe’s conduct and professionalism are extremely rare and I hope that you will take immediate action and utilize his services for any executive search needs that you might have.  Joe will go the extra mile for you because he is willing to make the investment with each client and understanding your needs first.  In a crowed field Joe Buonassissi stands out.</p>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="4" data-line-end="5">To Whom It May Concern:</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="3" data-line-end="4">I am pleased to write this letter of recommendation for Joe Buonassissi.  I have worked with Joe since early 2000, as the Chief Operating Officer for I-Sky and had no prior experience or knowledge of Joe prior to that time.  I continue to work with Joe because of the high degree of integrity and the uncompromising values he places in our relationship as well as the relations he forges with the individuals he recommends for placement.  Joe always will do what is right for every party and has demonstrated extreme flexibility, creativity, and common sense in helping match the right talents for key positions.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="5" data-line-end="6">Each and every person Joe has placed with me has excelled and exceeded our companyâ€™s expectations.  It is because of these values and track record that I continue to use Joe and can highly recommend that you give him an opportunity to prove his talents and value; I guarantee that you wonâ€™t be disappointed.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="7" data-line-end="8">Please feel free to contact me if I can answer any questions or be of further assistance, 703-788-5566.</p>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2" data-line-end="3">Having worked with Joe for several years, I can unequivocally state that he is among the top recruiters I have ever worked with. Without any hesitation, I would use his expertise any time.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="4" data-line-end="5">Unlike most recruiters, Joe takes time to understand his client’s needs at a level that is unsurpassed.  He not only takes time to understand the organization and its capabilities/services etc., but also understands the culture, values and management style.  He does the same for each candidate that he evaluates. This allows for a better match when it comes to selecting the right candidate.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="6" data-line-end="7">As they say, first impressions are lasting impressions. Joe, creates a great first impression of the company that he represents. In our competitive business this helps  in attracting the talent we want.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="8" data-line-end="9">I am happy to recommend Joe Buonassissi</p>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="4" data-line-end="5">To Whom It May Concern:</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2" data-line-end="3">Originally I met Joe Buonassissi around 2004 when he called out of the blue to recruit me for a seriously challenging global HRHD program for a global Fortune 100 company. He portrayed the business needs of the client honestly and provided me more than enough informaion to make an informed decision - something I appreciate deeply and expect from my business partners. Joe demonstrated his trustworthiness and candor in spades. We were fast friends.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="4" data-line-end="5">In the ensuing years I’ve worked with him on several other opportunities, including turning the tables and having him be a recruiter for me when I was with SAP and Cognizant. His candidates were always top drawer, strong and solid performers because Joe did his job of finding out what was important to the practice, the team, the customer, the role and to me. He’s an excellent communicator, very personable and likeable, easy to talk to and explain what you need in a candidate Joe finds them.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="6" data-line-end="7">The sheer volume of words of esteem cannot express how much I think of Joe and highly recommend him knowing he can do the job.</p>
